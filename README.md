# Usage Notes for "Dataset of human skin and fingernails images for non-invasive haemoglobin level assessment"

This repository contains code that demonstrates the ability to create machine learning models from nail and hand skin image data from "Dataset of human skin and fingernails images for non-invasive haemoglobin level assessment". 

This repository contains code that demonstrates the ability to create machine learning models from nail and hand skin image data from "Dataset of human skin and fingernails images for non-invasive haemoglobin level assessment".

The file `Usage notes.ipynb` contains basic steps describing raw image preprocessing, feature extraction, model tuning and evaluation on hold-out validation and test sets in Python 3.9. The `requirements.txt` file contains the necessary libraries used for data processing.

All instructions for running are inside `Usage notes.ipynb`.

The interactive notebook assumes that the data files are in the `data` directory. The metadata file has the path `data/metadata.csv`, the source images are stored in the path `data/photo/...`.
